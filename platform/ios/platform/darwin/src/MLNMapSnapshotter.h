/**
 An `MLNMapSnapshotter` generates static raster images of the map. Each snapshot
 image depicts a portion of a map defined by an `MLNMapSnapshotOptions` object
 you provide. The snapshotter generates an `MLNMapSnapshot` object
 asynchronously, calling `MLNMapSnapshotterDelegate` methods if defined, then
 passing it into a completion handler once tiles and other resources needed for
 the snapshot are finished loading.
 
 You can change the snapshotter’s options at any time and reuse the snapshotter
 for multiple distinct snapshots; however, the snapshotter can only generate one
 snapshot at a time. If you need to generate multiple snapshots concurrently,
 create multiple snapshotter objects.
 
 For an interactive map, use the `MLNMapView` class. Both `MLNMapSnapshotter`
 and `MLNMapView` are compatible with offline packs managed by the
 `MLNOfflineStorage` class.
 
 From a snapshot, you can obtain an image and convert geographic coordinates to
 the image’s coordinate space in order to superimpose markers and overlays. If
 you do not need offline map functionality, you can use the `Snapshot` class in
 [MapboxStatic.swift](https://github.com/mapbox/MapboxStatic.swift/) to generate
 static map images with overlays.
 
 ### Example
 
 ```swift
 let camera = MLNMapCamera(lookingAtCenter: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 37.7184, longitude: -122.4365), altitude: 100, pitch: 20, heading: 0)
 
 let options = MLNMapSnapshotOptions(styleURL: MLNStyle.satelliteStreetsStyleURL, camera: camera, size: CGSize(width: 320, height: 480))
 options.zoomLevel = 10
 
 let snapshotter = MLNMapSnapshotter(options: options)
 snapshotter.start { (snapshot, error) in
     if let error = error {
         fatalError(error.localizedDescription)
     }
     
     image = snapshot?.image
 }
 ```
