MapLibre GL Native for macOS is compatible with macOS 10.10.0 and above for Cocoa applications developed in Objective-C, Swift, Interface Builder, or AppleScript. For hybrid applications, consider [MapLibre GL JS]([https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js)).
