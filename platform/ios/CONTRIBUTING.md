# Contributing

If you have a usage question for a product built on Maplibre GL Native (such as our iOS or Android SDKs), please create a discussion thread on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native/discussions/categories/q-a).

If you want to contribute code:

1. Please familiarize yourself with the [install process](./INSTALL.md).

1. Ensure that existing [pull requests](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AiOS) and [issues](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AiOS) donâ€™t already cover your contribution or question.

2. Pull requests are gladly accepted. If there are any changes that developers using one of the GL SDKs should be aware of, please update the **main** section of the [iOS changelog](platform/ios/CHANGELOG.md) or [macOS changelog](platform/macos/CHANGELOG.md).

3. Prefix your commit messages with the platform(s) your changes affect: `[ios]` or `[macos]`.

Please note the special instructions for contributing new source code files, asset files, or user-facing strings to the [iOS SDK](platform/ios/DEVELOPING.md#contributing) or [macOS SDK](platform/macos/DEVELOPING.md#contributing).
