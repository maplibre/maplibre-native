# Building & Developing from Source

**Just trying to use one of the Mapbox Maps SDKs? You don't need to read this stuff! We
provide [easy-to-install, prebuilt versions of the SDK for iOS
that you can download instantly and get started with fast](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native-distribution).**

If you're certain you need to build from source, rather than using a prebuilt SDK, please
refer to the installation instructions for the platform of interest:

* [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS](platform/ios/INSTALL.md)
* [Mapbox Maps SDK for macOS](platform/macos/INSTALL.md)
