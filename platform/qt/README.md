# MapLibre Native for Qt

[![GitHub Action build status](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/workflows/qt-ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/actions/workflows/qt-ci.yml)

MapLibre native Qt bindings have been moved to
[maplibre-native-qt](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native-qt) repository.
This folder only contains minimal platform-specific implementation and allows
sufficient testing of the MapLibre Core built with Qt as platform.
