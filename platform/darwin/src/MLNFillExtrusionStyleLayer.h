 An ``MLNFillExtrusionStyleLayer`` is a style layer that renders one or more 3D
 extruded polygons on the map.

 Use a fill-extrusion style layer to configure the visual appearance of polygon
 or multipolygon features. These features can come from vector tiles loaded by
 an ``MLNFillExtrusionStyleLayer`` object, or they can be
 ``MLNFillExtrusionStyleLayer``, ``MLNFillExtrusionStyleLayer``,
 ``MLNFillExtrusionStyleLayer``, or ``MLNFillExtrusionStyleLayer`` instances in
 an ``MLNFillExtrusionStyleLayer`` or ``MLNFillExtrusionStyleLayer`` object.

 You can access an existing fill-extrusion style layer using the
 ``MLNStyle/layerWithIdentifier:`` method if you know its identifier;
 otherwise, find it using the ``MLNStyle/layers`` property. You can also create a
 new fill-extrusion style layer and add it to the style using a method such as
 ``MLNStyle/addLayer:``.
