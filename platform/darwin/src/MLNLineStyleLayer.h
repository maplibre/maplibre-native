 An ``MLNLineStyleLayer`` is a style layer that renders one or more stroked
 polylines on the map.

 Use a line style layer to configure the visual appearance of polyline or
 multipolyline features. These features can come from vector tiles loaded by an
 ``MLNLineStyleLayer`` object, or they can be ``MLNLineStyleLayer``,
 ``MLNLineStyleLayer``, ``MLNLineStyleLayer``, or ``MLNLineStyleLayer``
 instances in an ``MLNLineStyleLayer`` or ``MLNLineStyleLayer`` object.

 You can access an existing line style layer using the
 ``MLNStyle/layerWithIdentifier:`` method if you know its identifier;
 otherwise, find it using the ``MLNStyle/layers`` property. You can also create a
 new line style layer and add it to the style using a method such as
 ``MLNStyle/addLayer:``.
