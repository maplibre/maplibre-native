/**
 An ``MLNRasterStyleLayer`` is a style layer that renders georeferenced raster
 imagery on the map, especially raster tiles.

 Use a raster style layer to configure the color parameters of raster tiles
 loaded by an ``MLNRasterStyleLayer`` object or raster images loaded by an
 ``MLNRasterStyleLayer`` object. For example, you could use a raster style layer
 to render <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/satellite/">Mapbox Satellite</a>
 imagery, a <a
 href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/tileset/#raster-tilesets">raster
 tile set</a> uploaded to Mapbox Studio, or a raster map authored in <a
 href="https://tilemill-project.github.io/tilemill/">TileMill</a>, the classic
 Mapbox Editor, or Mapbox Studio Classic.

 Raster images may also be used as icons or patterns in a style layer. To
 register an image for use as an icon or pattern, use the
 ``MLNStyle/setImage:forName:`` method. To configure a point annotation’s image,
 use the ``MLNRasterStyleLayer`` class.

 You can access an existing raster style layer using the
 ``MLNStyle/layerWithIdentifier:`` method if you know its identifier;
 otherwise, find it using the ``MLNStyle/layers`` property. You can also create a
 new raster style layer and add it to the style using a method such as
 ``MLNStyle/addLayer:``.

 an image</a> and <a
 href="https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/examples/source-custom-raster/">Add
