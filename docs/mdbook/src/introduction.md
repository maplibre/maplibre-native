# Introduction

*[MapLibre Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native)* is a community led fork of *Mapbox GL Native*. It's a C++ library that powers 
vector maps in native applications on multiple platforms by taking stylesheets that conform to the *[MapLibre Style Specification](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/)*, a fork of the 
Mapbox Style Spec. Since it is derived from Mapbox's original work it also uses *Mapbox Vector Tile Specification* as its choice of vector tile format.
