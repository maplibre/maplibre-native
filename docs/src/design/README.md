# Design

*[MapLibre GL Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native)* is a community led fork of *Mapbox GL Native*. It's a C++ library that powers 
vector maps in native applications on multiple platforms by taking stylesheets that conform to the *MapLibre Style Specification,* a fork of the 
Mapbox Style Specification. Since it is derived from Mapbox's original work it also uses *Mapbox Vector Tile Specification* as its choice of vector tile format.

This primary purpose of this section is to document current state of MapLibre GL Native. [Architectural Problems and Recommendations](./archictural-problems-and-recommendations.md) section also notes recommendations for future improvements from an architectural perspective.
