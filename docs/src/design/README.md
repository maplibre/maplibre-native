# Design

*[MapLibre GL Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native)* is a community led fork of *Mapbox GL Native*. It's a C++ library that powers 
vector maps in native applications on multiple platforms by taking stylesheets that conform to the *MapLibre Style Specification,* a fork of the 
Mapbox Style Specification. Since it is derived from Mapbox's original work it also uses *Mapbox Vector Tile Specification* as its choice of vector tile format.

This book's primary purpose is to document current state of MapLibre GL Native. This book also notes recommendations for future
improvements from an architectural perspective. It does not dive into implementation details for brevity.
