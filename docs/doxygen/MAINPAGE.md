# MapLibre GL Native Core Documentation

This is the documentation of the public C++ API of MapLibre GL Native Core. You would normally only use this API if you are a contributor to one of the platform specific APIs. If you want to intergrate use MapLibre GL Native in your project, you are better served by [documentation specific to your platform](https://maplibre.org/projects/maplibre-native/), unless you are interested in the internals of MapLibre GL Native.

The source code can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native) (the `include` directory contains the public API).
