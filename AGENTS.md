You are making webgpu support for maplibre native. Maplibre native already supports vulkan/metal/opengl. Dawn is found in ./vendor/dawn, and the cmakeflags are MLN_WITH_WEBGPU=ON and the one that instructs the webgpu backend to be dawn. Test with glfw example (./run_webgpu.sh). Dont ask for permission, just get the work resolved all the way till we have visually rendered a maplibre map with webgpu/glfw. You can compare with metal/vulkan which are working. Write down you findings in the SITUATION.md file. Use maplibre demotiles as style (https://demotiles.maplibre.org/style.json) - dont use commercial styles like maptiler
