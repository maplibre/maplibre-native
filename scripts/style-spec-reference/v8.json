Use `text-justify: auto` to choose justification based on anchor position. \n\n The length of the array must be even, and must alternate between enum and point entries. i.e., each anchor location must be accompanied by a point, and that point defines the offset when the corresponding anchor location is used. Positive offset values indicate right and down, while negative values indicate left and up. Anchor locations may repeat, allowing the renderer to try multiple offsets to try and place a label using the same anchor. \n\n When present, this property takes precedence over `text-anchor`, `text-variable-anchor`, `text-offset`, and `text-radial-offset`. \n\n ```json \n { \"text-variable-anchor-offset\": [\"top\", [0, 4], \"left\", [3,0], \"bottom\", [1, 1]] } \n ``` \n\n When the renderer chooses the `top` anchor, `[0, 4]` will be used for `text-offset`; the text will be shifted down by 4 ems. \n\n When the renderer chooses the `left` anchor, `[3, 0]` will be used for `text-offset`; the text will be shifted right by 3 ems.",
